1. 3D volumes by looking at slices and line profiles of the data.
2. 2D images with adjustments to colour scales.

To load, just open the file in IGOR Pro, or drag and drop. Then compile in IGOR Pro. Select Windows>Panel Macros and it should pop up on screen. Navigate to your directory of interest in the Data Browser and waves should come up in the drop down menu.
